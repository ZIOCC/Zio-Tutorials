Check out the full tutorial blog for this project on our blog 
[link: https://www.smart-prototyping.com/blog/Build-A-Digital-Code-Lock] (here).

== Step 1: Installation
For this project, we will build a simple digital code lock that users can enter and key in. In this tutorial, we will show users how a digital code lock system works in an Arduino Interface.

- By the end of this tutorial you will be able to :
- Set up a digital code lock with Zio and basic 12 keys keypad
- Be able to interface with Arduino IDE to program Zio with keypad
- Create a program that asks users to enter a six-digit password to unlock 
- Be able to create a new six-digit password


== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram schematics.png attached to the sketch

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board
